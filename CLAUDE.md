# Magic Village Dash

## Purpose
A stylized **three-lane endless runner** for mobile, built in Unity 6. The player guides a character
(currently a **wolf**) through a procedurally streamed village, dodging hazards, collecting coins,
fighting/avoiding enemies, and chasing best runs. This is also the real-world **consumer/testbed** for
the `com.erccdev.foundation` package — game systems are built on top of that shared library.

## Relationship to ErccDev Foundation
Game code depends on the Foundation package via UPM git URL:
```
"com.erccdev.foundation": "https://github.com/ercc98/Foundation.git"
```
Foundation provides the reusable base (EventBus, SaveService, audio toolkit, swipe/touch input, scene
loader, camera shaker, pause, tutorial, pooling/factories). Game scripts subclass/wire those bases.
When a game feature needs a generic capability, prefer adding it to Foundation and consuming it here.
There is **no** `Assets/Scripts/ErccDev/` folder anymore — that tooling now comes from the package.

## Key dependencies
- `com.unity.addressables` 2.8.0
- `com.unity.cinemachine` 3.1.5
- `com.unity.inputsystem` 1.18.0 (new Input System; `ISwipeInput` abstraction from Foundation)
- `com.unity.localization` 1.5.9
- **Firebase** (analytics) and **Google AdMob** (interstitial ads)

## Layout
- `Assets/Scripts/MagicVillageDash/` — all game-specific code, organized by module:
  - `Runner/` — `LaneRunner` + `ILaneMover` (CharacterController movement, lane snapping, jump/slide/defend).
  - `Character/` — `CharacterControllerBase`, `IMovementController`, `ShadowMover`, and
    `CharacterAnimator/` (`CharacterAnimatorController` with `IMovement/IDeath/IExpression` animator interfaces).
  - `Player/` — `PlayerController`.
  - `World/` — procedural streaming: `ChunkSpawner`, `ChunkFactory`, `ChunkRoot`, `WorldMover`,
    shared `GameSpeedController`, plus `Biomes/` (`BiomeDirector`, `BiomeDefinition`,
    `BiomeTransitionOption`, `ChunkFactoryInstaller`) and `WorldReward3D`.
  - `Enemy/` — `EnemyAI`, `EnemyController`, `EnemySensors`, `EnemySpawnManager`, `EnemyFactory`,
    `EnemyDeathReward`, spawn-permission gating (`IEnemySpawnPermission`).
  - `Collectibles/` — `CoinFactory`, `CoinRailGenerator/Filler`, `CoinCollectible`, collected-coin variants.
  - `Obstacles/` — `ObstacleHazard`, `ObstacleFactory`, rail generators, `IHazardReceiver`.
  - `Score/` — `CoinCounter`, `DistanceTracker`, `RunScoreSystem` (persists high score/distance/coins
    via Foundation's `SaveService`).
  - `Gameplay/` — `RunController`, `IHazardReceiver`.
  - `Input/` — `RunnerSwipeController` + `IRunnerInputController` (glue to Foundation swipe input).
  - `Audio/` — `AudioManager` + `IAudioManager`, `SoundIds`.
  - `Camera/` — `CameraShaker`.
  - `UI/` — HUD texts (`Coin/Distance/Score`), `SimpleGameMenus`, `PauseMenuUI`, `SettingsMenuUI`, `CoinComboUI`.
  - `Tutorial/` — swipe-driven `TutorialManager`, `TutorialOverlayUI`, `TutorialTriggerStep`, context builders.
  - `Pause/` — `PauseApplier`, `PauseServiceBehaviour`.
  - `Settings/` — `GraphicsQualityManager`, `SettingsApplier` + `ISettingsApplier`.
  - `Data/` — `GameDataService`, `RunStatsData`, `AchievementData`, `DenPlacementData` (slot↔entry
    placements for the den; ownership lives in the collection, this only records *where* each owned
    structure is built so the den rebuilds identically next session).
  - `Achievements/` — `AchievementManager` (on Foundation's `AchievementManagerBase`), `AchievementContextBuilder`,
    `Conditions/` (coins/distance/score reached), `Rewards/` (`CoinReward`, `EventBusReward`); persisted via `GameDataService`.
  - `Collections/` — `CollectionManager` (on Foundation's `CollectionManagerBase`, lives as a prefab —
    `Assets/Prefabs/CollectionManager.prefab`), `CollectionShowcase`, `ModelCollectionEntry`,
    `CollectionCatalog` (shared list of every entry); relics (`Collectibles/RelicCollectible`,
    `RelicFactory`, `RelicRailFiller`) and achievements feed discoveries. Discovering an entry makes it
    *owned* (recorded in `CollectionProgressData`); the den reads ownership from here.
  - `Den/Placement/` — the den's "earn it → place it" loop: `DenPlacementController` (builds the tray as
    owned − placed, runs the tap-item → tap-slot place flow, rebuilds saved placements on load), `DenSlot`
    (a buildable spot tagged `DenSlot`, with a tappable arrow indicator and stable `SlotId`),
    `DenTrayCarouselUI` + `DenTrayItemView` (swipeable bottom tray of unplaced structures). Reward-agnostic
    and read-only against the collection; placement persists via `DenPlacementData`.
  - `Notifications/` — `NotificationManager` + `NotificationToastView` (game toasts on Foundation's
    `NotificationManagerBase`/`NotificationViewBase`), `NotificationTester` (dev-only harness). Achievement/Collection
    toasts come via Foundation's source bridges. Tintable toast art lives in `Assets/Images/Notifications/`.
  - `AdMobScripts/` — `Interstitial`. `FirebaseScripts/` — `FirebaseAnalyticsService`. `Boostrap/` — `LogoSceneController`.
- `Assets/Scenes/` — `IntroScene` (title) → `RunnerScene` (core gameplay) → `DenScene` (meta-progression
  den, see below). All three are in the build settings; `SampleScene` is disabled. Den ↔ Runner navigation
  was wired on the `ConnectDenWithRunnerScenes` branch (commit `9df1cb1`).
- `Assets/IgnoreFolder/` — gitignored; holds **licensed third-party asset packs** not in the repo
  (wolf pack, low-poly environment, ambient effects, UI sound packs). The project won't fully open
  without these placed manually (see commit `a35daf4`).

## Conventions (match these when adding code)
- **Interface-driven, SOLID with personality** — mirror the Foundation style: `IThing` interface +
  concrete/base behaviour, factories for spawnable objects (`ChunkFactory`, `CoinFactory`,
  `EnemyFactory`, `ObstacleFactory`), terse helpers, null-guard early returns, concise XML summaries.
  Don't rewrite working code into generic textbook style — preserve the author's voice.
- **Build on Foundation, don't reinvent** — use `SaveService`, EventBus, the audio toolkit, swipe input,
  pause and tutorial bases from the package rather than duplicating them here.
- **Factory + rail/generator pattern** for streamed content (coins, obstacles, chunks, enemies).
- Namespaces follow the folder path under `MagicVillageDash`.

## Gameplay loop
1. Player spawns centered on the lane grid (`IntroScene` → `RunnerScene`).
2. `WorldMover`/`GameSpeedController` advance chunks toward the camera; `ChunkSpawner` recycles new
   chunks ahead, `BiomeDirector` controls biome (e.g. forest/town) transitions.
3. Coins and enemy/world rewards update the HUD and feed `RunScoreSystem`; distance adds points over time.
4. Hitting an `ObstacleHazard` (or enemy) ends the run; `RunScoreSystem` commits new records via `SaveService`.
5. `SimpleGameMenus` / `PauseMenuUI` drive intro ↔ gameplay ↔ game-over ↔ pause states.

## Working in this repo
- ⚠️ The `unity-mcp` MCP server no longer works — do not rely on it for driving the Unity editor.
- Current dev happens on feature branches (`ChangingVisuals`, `BiomeImplementation`, `enemyBehavoir`,
  `Localization`, `MakingTutorial`, `mobilePolish`, `DenSystem`, `game-comfort-fixes`, …); `main` is the
  integration branch. The den/collection/achievement/notification systems are all merged to `main`;
  active polish lives on `game-comfort-fixes`.
- ⚠️ **Security:** history contains a branch named `GoogleAPIKeyLeaked` — a Google API key was likely
  committed at some point. If still live, rotate/revoke it and scrub it from history; never commit keys.
- When adding gameplay tuning knobs, expose them on the relevant controller (`GameSpeedController`,
  `RunScoreSystem`) rather than hardcoding.

## Den System (Built — merged to `main`)
A cozy meta-progression layer on top of the runner loop. The MVP loop (earn → place) is functional;
remaining work is content (more structures/slots) and the post-MVP ideas below.

### Core Concept
Fixed view of a forest clearing ("Wolfland") that grows as the player earns rewards from races.
Race → earn a structure drop → place it in the den. No shop or currency conversion — the reward IS
the structure.

### How it's wired (built, merged to `main`)
The MVP plan's separate "DenResourceData inventory" was folded into the **collection** instead — there's
one source of ownership, not two:
- **Ownership = discovery.** Picking up a relic or unlocking an achievement discovers a `ModelCollectionEntry`
  (`CollectionProgressData.discoveredIds`). The entry carries the tray `icon` and the built `modelPrefab`.
  Every entry is listed in `CollectionCatalog`.
- **`DenPlacementData`** records only slot↔entry placements (`{slotId, entryId}`), so the den rebuilds
  identically each session. **Tray = owned − placed.**
- **`DenPlacementController`** (in `DenScene`) builds the tray from the catalog/collection, runs the place
  flow (tap a tray item → free `DenSlot` arrows light up → tap one → structure spawns from `modelPrefab`
  and saves), and rebuilds saved placements on load. `DenTrayCarouselUI`/`DenTrayItemView` are the tray;
  `DenSlot` (tag `DenSlot`) marks each buildable spot.
- Tapping a built structure with nothing armed tears it down and returns it to the tray (the placement is
  cleared and re-saved) — `DenPlacementController.TryPickUpAtPointer` (added on `game-comfort-fixes`).
- Persistence rides `GameDataService`'s SO save list (`collectionProgress` + `denPlacement` wired on the
  `GameDataService` prefab). Structures so far: Campfire, Swing, Tent, Well, OutlookPost.

### Post-MVP Ideas
- Visiting wolves that react to built structures and leave rewards
- 4 territory growth stages (Wild Clearing → Settled Den → Pack Territory → Ancient Ground)
- Day/night cycle and weather events
- Cinematic cut of wolf returning to den after race
- Rival dens — challenge other players from the den screen
- Seasonal events (winter snow, holiday structures)
- Den biome skins (Dark Forest, Sunny Meadow, Misty Mountains)

### Placeable Structures (full list)
Cave, Ancient Tree, Campfire, Meat Rack, Herb Garden, Log Bridge, Lookout Rock, Creek
